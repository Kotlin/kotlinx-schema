## Before You Submit

### About PR Size
_Smaller PRs lead to faster reviews, shorter feedback cycles, and better code quality.
Large PRs (500+ lines) are harder to review thoroughly and increase the risk of bugs slipping through._

**Aim for PRs under 200 lines when possible.**
If your PR is large, consider splitting it into focused, incremental changes.

### Pre-Submission Checklist

- [ ] **Self-reviewed** my own code
- [ ] **Tests added/updated** and passing locally
- [ ] **Documentation updated** (if needed: README, code comments, etc.)
- [ ] **Focused PR**: Single concern, no unrelated changes or "drive-by" fixes
- [ ] **Breaking changes documented** (if applicable)
